    - Start with just this video -- revisit 
        [the course](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-computing-in-practice) later.

    - Quantum Utility (quantum computers outperform classical computers at certain tasks useful) vs.
        Quantum Advantage (quantum computers outperform classical computers at certain tasks)

    - Moore's law is an *observation* that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years.
        Ultimately, this trend will be constrained by the physical limit that a transistor cannot be
        smaller than an atom.
    
    - [Landauer's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle) places a lower-bound
        on the amount of energy consumed by classical computation.

    - **A great analogy from Quantum computing: It's too costly to simulate wind,
        so car companies use a physical tunnel to test cars!**

## Textbooks

The books listen here are not necessarily directly related to quantum computing.
They are intended for building a fundamental understanding of the physics and
mathematics that underlie the discipline.
